This was fully made with chatgpt so Not sure why there is a server.js and etc, just including it incase might be linked to something (I have tested and modifiyed yes)

To install Make sure you have Apache2 Or a diffrent kind of webhost i did this using apache2 myself, belive you can use nginx but yet to test
Install npm/node.js as it is needed/used i belive
To run just use ur Webhost/Web server and start it there is 4 pages a admin panel and a bit more, ui is still a bit bad but will update later on.
The deafult admin creds are Username: admin Password: password all lowercase :)
